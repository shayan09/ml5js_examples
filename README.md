## ml5_js
Machine Learning Implementation in JavaScript using ml5.js for Classification and Object Detection.

#### Why ml5.js?
ml5.js aims to make machine learning approachable for a broad audience of artists, creative coders, and students. 
The library provides access to machine learning algorithms and models in the browser, building on top of TensorFlow.js with 
no other external dependencies. <br>
ml5.js is an open source, friendly high level interface to TensorFlow.js, a library for handling GPU-accelerated mathematical operations
and memory management for machine learning algorithms. 

This repository contains some examples for you to get started with ml5.js If you don't know how to start a server, check [this guide](https://learn.ml5js.org/docs/#/tutorials/local-web-server?id=running-a-local-web-server) on how to start a local web server.
